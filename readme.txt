THis is the initial log after many upsets to this point. I had previously started with great intentions but found that working with Git Hub was creating me great problems. I believe the issue was that I was unable to synd a repository I had created in Git Hub and then to sync that repository with a repository I had on my own machine locally. So hopefully this is now working. Only 2 weeks to go so it better be correct.

After commiting the files and also pushing the origin to master, we have success.....so onward and upward!

My intention is to take each part of the roblem and to break it down into one simple and easily run script. If I was reviewing this project at the end I would prefer if there were zero istructions.....and one step from zero is 1 step. SO  believe if I can create a script that will output the required data each time a button is pressed then after a number of key presses all the information will hve been dissemitated. Of course it all depends if I can accomplish this feat. But it shouldn;t be too great. 

I also intened to create the usual files as requested from the initial proposed minimum requirements of the project, with maybe some other ways to look at the data set.....as there are many ways to analyse / view this data. All will be revealed in due course. I was a little naiive on this one as what I thought to be a simple one turned out to be a rather difficult task. Yes I could create seperate plots for each data set, but I was unable to get them displayed in the same window. Not so good for me! Back to Matplotlib documentation and i realised I needed to invoke subplots. Because I didn;t want to possibly lose the work I had already done, I useda previous test file to try and do what I needed to do, thereby preserving the original working file. 

So I have managed to get the plots and subplots I wanted, so I am somewhat pleased at this stage. However, I need now to give some analysis on the actual plots. Ia m using scatter pots as the data is quite "scattered" and I believe it is a good way to show data as it was gathered back in 1936. 

SO my thinking now is to demonstrate to the user how to get the initial plots, in the current form i.e. 3 plots in one window and to demonstrate how this format is not much use to us a observers. It is more of a summary of the data and it is not a summary we are after. We are after insights. 

So my documentation should show that the resulting graphs from this section are not much use ad this is why i have decided to move in a nother direction and to plot all the data in one plot. This should allow us to start make sense of the data.
