This repository contains a number of files. 
1. The Project file as given to us earlier in the semester. 
2. This readme.txt file which includes the instructios for retrieving the result. 
3. An accompanying word doc named Project_IrisDataSet.docx.
4. The Python script Project_IrisDataSetAnalysis.py - this is the script. 
5. Another Python script used for the rough work: TEst_DataSetImport.py



Instructions:
1. Using CMDer, run using python the file Project_IrisDataSetAnalysis.py
2. After an image appears on screen, to progress, close it and hit enter to progress to next plot.
3. After each plot you will need to hit enter to progress. 
4. 5 plots in total will be displayed and after the 5th has been displayed you will be prompted to "hit enter 
to finish"
5. The idea is that the 5 plots are saved to your own working directory as Python is executing the script. These images can be used later within the word docuent (that already contains the various umages being generated by the sript). 
6. The files generated are named Figures 7, 9, 10 to 12. 

Note: The file TEst_DataSetImport.py was used as a test script where any of the rough work was done before submitting it into the TEst_DataSetImport.py file. 

Note: The Iris Data Set is retrieved from the SCIKIT database hosting website. hence it is not in theis repository.

Note: The Accompanying word document should be read in conjucntion witht he running of the python script. 

Best regards,
