THis is the initial log after many upsets to this point. I had previously started with great intentions but found that working with Git Hub was creating me great problems. I believe the issue was that I was unable to synd a repository I had created in Git Hub and then to sync that repository with a repository I had on my own machine locally. So hopefully this is now working. Only 2 weeks to go so it better be correct.

After commiting the files and also pushing the origin to master, we have success.....so onward and upward!

My intention is to take each part of the roblem and to break it down into one simple and easily run script. If I was reviewing this project at the end I would prefer if there were zero istructions.....and one step from zero is 1 step. SO  believe if I can create a script that will output the required data each time a button is pressed then after a number of key presses all the information will hve been dissemitated. Of course it all depends if I can accomplish this feat. But it shouldn;t be too great. 

I also intened to create the usual files as requested from the initial proposed minimum requirements of the project, with maybe some other ways to look at the data set.....as there are many ways to analyse / view this data. All will be revealed in due course.
